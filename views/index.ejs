        <h1>Rewards Program<br>Point Submission</h1>
    
        <p>Welcome to the new online point submission for the Healthy Horizons rewards program!  This website is an online submission process that serves as an alternative to the form you might submit at the end of the semester.</p>

        <p>If you'd like to try to submit your points online click on the <a href="./points">points</a> tab.  You can still print and turn in the <a href="./resources/PointSubmission.pdf">paper form</a> instead of submitting online if you'd like.</p>

        <h2>About this Website</h2>
        
        <p style= "padding-top:20px">
            This webpage started as an Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) project through the Computer Science Program at Butler University. The EPICS program allows Computer Science students at Butler University to complete projects for organizations throughout the Indianapolis area.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The Healthy Horizons program came to the EPICS coordinator Dr. Panos Linos to recruit a team of students to find an alternative to the paper form submission.  The students thought a webpage was a great alternative!
