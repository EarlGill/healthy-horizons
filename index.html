        <h4>About Healthy Horizons</h4>
        <p>
            As faculty and staff members of Butler University (“University”), you are eligible to
    participate in the Butler University Healthy Horizons Program (“Program”). Healthy
    Horizons programs and services are also available to, spouses, and dependents 6
    years of age and older, if they are enrolled in the University’s group health plan. The
    Healthy Horizons Program is sponsored by the University through the College of
    Pharmacy and Health Sciences Health and Wellness Center ("Health and Wellness
    Center"). The purpose of this Program is to promote healthful living by providing a
    comprehensive wellness package to you. This Program will assist you in improving
    your health, provide you with ongoing information and health education programs, help
    you lead a healthier life and stay well, and help you to identify your own health risks and
    ways to reduce these risks. The Healthy Horizons Program is not intended to replace
    your usual and appropriate medical care from your own physician or primary health care
    provider. It is intended to help you, with your physician’s support, improve your health
    through education and activities that focus on healthy behaviors.
