    <p style="margin: 5px">
        As faculty and staff members of Butler University (“University”), you are eligible to
participate in the Butler University Healthy Horizons Program (“Program”). Healthy
Horizons programs and services are also available to, spouses, and dependents 6
years of age and older, if they are enrolled in the University’s group health plan. The
Healthy Horizons Program is sponsored by the University through the College of
Pharmacy and Health Sciences Health and Wellness Center ("Health and Wellness
Center"). The purpose of this Program is to promote healthful living by providing a
comprehensive wellness package to you. This Program will assist you in improving
your health, provide you with ongoing information and health education programs, help
you lead a healthier life and stay well, and help you to identify your own health risks and
ways to reduce these risks. The Healthy Horizons Program is not intended to replace
your usual and appropriate medical care from your own physician or primary health care
provider. It is intended to help you, with your physician’s support, improve your health
through education and activities that focus on healthy behaviors.
