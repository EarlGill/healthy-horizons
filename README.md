## How to Start Server

Run `npm i` in the project folder.  Then run `node app.js` to start the server.

Additionally, you can install `nodemon` which will allow the server to auto refresh the page on saved changes.  To do this, install it using `npm i nodemon -g` and then run the server using `nodemon app.js`.
